# Environment setup
Make sure you're using [Python3]https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/ and the latest version of [Anaconda]https://www.anaconda.com/ package manager. Once everything is installed on your machine move to the repository folder on your Anaconda prompt and type ```conda create env tfld_env.yml```
Anaconda will fetch and install the required packages for the code. Once the installation is finished (you will be required to enter some confirmations) type ```activate tfdeeplearning``` and your Python environment will be done.
Enjoy!
